# PRE-FORMATION PROJECT
>This is my first site created as part of my pre-training at cf2m :

http://adrien.webdev-cf2m.be/

The instructions were to make a website around an exhibition on Brussels and an interview with a web developer.
My challenge was to make the site only in html and css.

## To begin
Make yourself comfortable.

## Prerequisite
For the most optimal experience, you will need :
* Open the site on ``Google Chrome``.
* With a screen ``1920 x 1080``.

## Designed
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
  - [Google](https://www.google.be/)
  - Ma formation au [cf2m](https://www.cf2m.be/)
